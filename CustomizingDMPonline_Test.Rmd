# Customizing DMPonline.be for your institution

This guide explains how organization admins can use the admin interface of *DMPonline.be* to customize the tool for their institutions.

## *DMPonline.be* has 3 'areas': 

+ a user interface ('orange') 
+ an admin area ('blue')
+ a super admin area ('black')

End users can view and create DMPs in the 'orange' user interface (see image below). The 'blue' admin area is the interface where organization admins can customize DMPonline.be for their institutions.

## Options for institutional customization

Using the admin area, you can: 

* add institutional DMP templates
* add institutional guidance
* adapt common (funder) templates

### Institutions can have their own DMP template(s)

* e.g. for researchers not required to write a DMP for a funder
* multiple templates per institution are possible
    + e.g. different templates for different groups (faculties, research groups, researchers at different career stages...)

![](/Users/Myriam/OneDrive - UGent/RDMPlanning/DMPonline/DMPbelgium/Admins/Customizing_Manual/CustomizingDMPonline_1_InstitutionMultipleTemplates.png)

### Main components of an institutional template

* RDM **questions**, grouped in **sections**
* **guidance** text to help users answer the questions
    + good way to provide recommendations, links to institutional online resources, support services, contact details for staff or helpdesks etc. 
* **answer box**, with various formats possible (text field, dropdown, radio buttons,...)
* **example/suggested answers** can also be provided 
    + useful to show the kind of response and/or level of detail required
* a template can have multiple **phases** 
    + e.g. an initial DMP created at proposal stage, a full DMP written during the project...
    + this reflects the idea of a DMP as a 'living' document

|question-specific guidance|themed guidance from organization|themed guidance from other sources (e.g. from subset of organization)|
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|associated with specific question in specific template|applies accross templates|applies accross templates (but can be made optional)|
|automatically opened next to question|open by clicking '+' sign|open by clicking '+' sign|
|usually pertains to same entity as template|pertains to institution as a whole|pertains to subset within institution (e.g. faculty, department, research institute...)| 
|appears as "Guidance"| e.g. "UGent guidance on Storage and Backup"| e.g. "Humanities Faculty guidance on Storage and Backup"|

#### Question-specific vs. themed guidance

More info about guidance themes: S. Jones (2014), [*Using the DMPonline admin interface: a guide to customizing the tool*](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/tools/dmpOnline/DMPonline-admin-interface-guide.pdf). Appendix 1

### Adapting funder templates

* add questions
    + your institution may want extra information that funders don't ask for 
    + researchers will probably not want to write a DMP for their funder AND their institution
* add suggested/example answers
    + to help researchers answer funder questions

## How to customize? Think about content first 

1. What are your institution's RDM requirements? Do you have an RDM policy?
2. If you require DMPs:
    + draft institutional template
    + review existing funder templates
3. Draft your guidance & example/suggested answers  
    
* More info: DCC, [Customising DMPonline for your institution: five steps to follow](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/tools/dmpOnline/DMPonline-customisation-guidelines.pdf)

### Typical topics covered in a DMP template

1. data collection
2. data documentation & metadata
3. ethical & legal issues
4. data storage & backup during research 
5. data preservation after research 
6. data sharing 
7. responsibilities & resources

### Need inspiration? 

Have a look at existing templates, e.g.

* DCC's [checklist for a Data Management Plan](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf)
* [Reseach Data Wiki - Datamanagementplannen](https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/RD/Datamanagementplannen) 
    
## Add customizations via the admin area
